We allow workers to be productive from anywhere on any device and have moved all the power of an on-premise phone system or contact center to the cloud to be accessed and used by modern workers in today's Work from Anywhere environment.

Who We Are

At Dialpad, work isn't a place you go, it's a thing you do. We not only build products to enable the everywhere worker, but we also are everywhere workers. With offices in San Francisco, San Ramon, Austin, Raleigh, Vancouver, Waterloo, Tokyo, London and Bangalore, we truly believe in finding the best talent everywhere. We also embrace the Work from Home movement and are just as happy hiring great talent from anywhere if they choose to work from home rather than in an office.

With $120 million in funding from ICONIQ Capital, Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Scale Ventures and other top VC's Dialpad attracts top engineers from companies like Microsoft and Google, and every member of our team plays an essential role in creating dynamic products that enable workers to be productive from anywhere.

About The Role

This role is on the Natural Language Processing team in the Voice Intelligence organization of Dialpad. As a Senior Applied Scientist you will study real human-human conversations, looking for ways that we could provide feedback to users so that they can have more effective, empathetic and engaged interactions with their customers. We take an eclectic approach, mixing insights and methods from Linguistics (Conversation Analysis, Sociolinguistics, syntax, semantics, Speech Act Theory) with empirical methods and state-of-the-art machine learning and computational linguistics. We have a diverse team of Applied Scientists and Data Analysts with backgrounds in Linguistics, Quantum Physics, Machine Learning, Material Science and Computer Science.

Our recent projects have focused on how to massage the transcripts of phone conversations to make them easier to read, how to extract action items and interesting customer questions, and how to model customer sentiment.

A typical project starts with a linguistic idea as you're poring over transcripts with colleagues. You notice a recurring pattern then validate that pattern with more data. In discussions with user design and product specialists, you discuss how this linguistic insight might contribute to a product feature, e.g. to point to interesting parts of the conversation. You then draft a proposal for a new feature and then supervise a data annotation project to get the data you'll be needing to train a machine-learned model. Eventually, that R&D results in some working code that you deploy in collaboration with the engineering teams.

You must have
A Masters or Ph.D. in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics or a related technical field
3+ years experience doing innovative hands-on research
Knowledge of machine learning, especially deep learning
Proficiency in Python
History of collaborating with colleagues to solve hard problems
Curiosity and desire to keep learning
Good linguistic judgments and insights
Fluency in English

Worked with conversational data or done a major descriptive linguistics project
A publication record in the area of computational linguistics

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe d'analyse chronologique est un équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, soit en prévision en détection des anomalies. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation chronologique, nettoyage de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :
Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.
Element AI souscrit au principe de l'égalité d'accès à l'emploi et favorise la diversité au sein du personnel. Nous ne pratiquons aucune discrimination sur la base de la race, de la religion, de la couleur de peau, du pays d'origine, du sexe, de l'orientation sexuelle, de l'âge, de l'état matrimonial, du statut d'ancien combattant ou des incapacités.

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The AI Core Time Series team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in the fields of time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from either a forecasting or anomaly detection perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series modelling and analysis, data cleaning, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models, machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:
Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.",3.4,"Element AI

Toronto, ON, CA
Posted: 5/14/2020 2:50:10 PM

Director, Physical Sciences Platform and Canada Research Chair – Tier 1 and Senior Scientist in Physical Sciences (one position)

Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) is seeking applications for the position of Director, Physical Sciences Platform. Applicants must hold a PhD in a relevant field (i.e. medical biophysics, bioengineering) and be eligible for appointment as a full-time Senior Scientist at SRI and as an Associate / Full Professor at the University of Toronto. We intend to nominate the selected candidate for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC). To fill this leadership role, we are seeking an outstanding, internationally renowned researcher whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their field and is proposing to extend their work through an original, innovative research program of the highest quality at SRI. The successful candidate will have a track record of leadership with administrative experience and have a vision towards leading and growing the Physical Sciences Platform and strengthening collaborations with Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and the Hospital. The Director will be expected to lead large, collaborative, cutting edge research endeavours that will yield scientific discoveries, clinical translation, commercialization and improved outcomes for patients.

About Sunnybrook Research Institute: SRI is an independent organization wholly owned by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, one of Canada’s leading academic health sciences centres. SRI is the research enterprise for the hospital corporation and is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. SRI has three research platforms: Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and Physical Sciences, each of which functions similarly to a university department under the leadership of a cognate director. The institute supports $100 million of annual research activities within approximately 250,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research space located at the Bayview campus of Sunnybrook. SRI has one of the best recognized and most productive teams in the field of medical imaging and physical sciences research in the world. The Physical Sciences Platform is comprised of 64 scientists, and has a total staff of ~300, including close to 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with the University of Toronto.

Research areas in Physical Sciences include Medical and Biological Imaging and Image Analysis (MRI, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Digital Pathology and Optical), Precision Medicine (Radiogenomics, Theranostics), Computational Modeling, Machine Learning, Nanomedicine, Design of Devices, Instrumentation and Interfaces, Biophysics and Bioengineering. A major focus of the Physical Sciences Platform at SRI is the field of Image Guided Therapy, reflected in support received from the Canada Foundation for Innovation leading to the establishment of the Centre for Research in Image Guided Therapeutics (CeRIGT), the FedDev-sponsored Image Guided Therapy cluster, and the current development of Inovait, an industry-academic consortium for AI and Image Guided Therapy supported by the federal Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF IV). The goal of the Physical Science Platform is to advance scientific discovery, develop new medical technologies and foster commercialization of discovery research. Our work further includes the delivery of novel diagnostic and interventional techniques to the hospital’s nine clinical programs: Holland Bone and Joint, Hurvitz Brain Sciences, Integrated Community Medicine, Odette Cancer, Schulich Heart, St. John’s Rehab, Tory Trauma, Veterans and DAN Women and Babies Programs. Scientists in this platform actively pursue opportunities to move their innovations through pre-clinical and first in human testing to commercialize the products of their research though the creation of start-ups and thought licensing, and routinely partner with many medical device companies in the development and assessment of new technologies.

The current Strategic Plan (2018-21) of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre aims to ensure that we can continue to achieve our vision of inventing the future of health care, and provide care for our patients and their families when it matters most. Our four Strategic Directions are focused on creating High Performing Teams that can develop Personalized and Precise Treatments, Integrated and Sustainable Models of Care, and Improve Quality and Create a Better Care Experience.

Responsibilities: Reporting to the Vice-President Research and Innovation, the Director will be responsible for the following: operations of the platform; strategic planning; recruitment; annual activities of research faculty; fiscal planning and accountability; and ensuring the integration of platform-based research with the strategic clinical directions of the hospital. The Director position will be initially awarded for a 5-year term, renewable following successful performance reviews, without a limit on the number of terms. The CRC is awarded for a 7-year term, renewable for a second 7-year term, contingent on a successful performance review.

Requirements for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair: Tier 1 CRCs are for outstanding established scholars. To meet the criteria of the program, nominees must: be outstanding and innovative world-class researchers whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their fields; be recognized internationally as leaders in their fields; have superior records of attracting and supervising graduate students and postdoctoral fellows (taking into account different practices in the relevant field or discipline) and, as a Chairholder, be expected to attract, develop and retain a diverse group of excellent trainees, students and future researchers; and propose an original, innovative research program of the highest quality.

For further information on the federally endowed CRCs, open to all nationalities, including eligibility criteria, please consult the Canada Research Chairs website. Sunnybrook Research Institute is committed to providing nominees with the support required to secure the CRC. For more information about CRC program at SRI, please contact Kevin Hamilton, director of business development and analytics, at kevin.hamilton@sri.utoronto.ca or visit SRI’s CRC website.

Candidates are encouraged to explain any interruptions in order to allow for a fair assessment of their application.

Director, Physical Sciences Platform and Canada Research Chair – Tier 1 and Senior Scientist in Physical Sciences - Sunnybrook Research Institute (SB05142020)

Toronto, ON, CA
Posted: 5/14/2020 2:50:10 PM

Director, Physical Sciences Platform and Canada Research Chair – Tier 1 and Senior Scientist in Physical Sciences (one position)

Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) is seeking applications for the position of Director, Physical Sciences Platform. Applicants must hold a PhD in a relevant field (i.e. medical biophysics, bioengineering) and be eligible for appointment as a full-time Senior Scientist at SRI and as an Associate / Full Professor at the University of Toronto. We intend to nominate the selected candidate for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC). To fill this leadership role, we are seeking an outstanding, internationally renowned researcher whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their field and is proposing to extend their work through an original, innovative research program of the highest quality at SRI. The successful candidate will have a track record of leadership with administrative experience and have a vision towards leading and growing the Physical Sciences Platform and strengthening collaborations with Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and the Hospital. The Director will be expected to lead large, collaborative, cutting edge research endeavours that will yield scientific discoveries, clinical translation, commercialization and improved outcomes for patients.

About Sunnybrook Research Institute: SRI is an independent organization wholly owned by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, one of Canada’s leading academic health sciences centres. SRI is the research enterprise for the hospital corporation and is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. SRI has three research platforms: Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and Physical Sciences, each of which functions similarly to a university department under the leadership of a cognate director. The institute supports $100 million of annual research activities within approximately 250,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research space located at the Bayview campus of Sunnybrook. SRI has one of the best recognized and most productive teams in the field of medical imaging and physical sciences research in the world. The Physical Sciences Platform is comprised of 64 scientists, and has a total staff of ~300, including close to 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with the University of Toronto.

Research areas in Physical Sciences include Medical and Biological Imaging and Image Analysis (MRI, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Digital Pathology and Optical), Precision Medicine (Radiogenomics, Theranostics), Computational Modeling, Machine Learning, Nanomedicine, Design of Devices, Instrumentation and Interfaces, Biophysics and Bioengineering. A major focus of the Physical Sciences Platform at SRI is the field of Image Guided Therapy, reflected in support received from the Canada Foundation for Innovation leading to the establishment of the Centre for Research in Image Guided Therapeutics (CeRIGT), the FedDev-sponsored Image Guided Therapy cluster, and the current development of Inovait, an industry-academic consortium for AI and Image Guided Therapy supported by the federal Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF IV). The goal of the Physical Science Platform is to advance scientific discovery, develop new medical technologies and foster commercialization of discovery research. Our work further includes the delivery of novel diagnostic and interventional techniques to the hospital’s nine clinical programs: Holland Bone and Joint, Hurvitz Brain Sciences, Integrated Community Medicine, Odette Cancer, Schulich Heart, St. John’s Rehab, Tory Trauma, Veterans and DAN Women and Babies Programs. Scientists in this platform actively pursue opportunities to move their innovations through pre-clinical and first in human testing to commercialize the products of their research though the creation of start-ups and thought licensing, and routinely partner with many medical device companies in the development and assessment of new technologies.

The current Strategic Plan (2018-21) of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre aims to ensure that we can continue to achieve our vision of inventing the future of health care, and provide care for our patients and their families when it matters most. Our four Strategic Directions are focused on creating High Performing Teams that can develop Personalized and Precise Treatments, Integrated and Sustainable Models of Care, and Improve Quality and Create a Better Care Experience.

Responsibilities: Reporting to the Vice-President Research and Innovation, the Director will be responsible for the following: operations of the platform; strategic planning; recruitment; annual activities of research faculty; fiscal planning and accountability; and ensuring the integration of platform-based research with the strategic clinical directions of the hospital. The Director position will be initially awarded for a 5-year term, renewable following successful performance reviews, without a limit on the number of terms. The CRC is awarded for a 7-year term, renewable for a second 7-year term, contingent on a successful performance review.

Requirements for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair: Tier 1 CRCs are for outstanding established scholars. To meet the criteria of the program, nominees must: be outstanding and innovative world-class researchers whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their fields; be recognized internationally as leaders in their fields; have superior records of attracting and supervising graduate students and postdoctoral fellows (taking into account different practices in the relevant field or discipline) and, as a Chairholder, be expected to attract, develop and retain a diverse group of excellent trainees, students and future researchers; and propose an original, innovative research program of the highest quality.

For further information on the federally endowed CRCs, open to all nationalities, including eligibility criteria, please consult the Canada Research Chairs website. Sunnybrook Research Institute is committed to providing nominees with the support required to secure the CRC. For more information about CRC program at SRI, please contact Kevin Hamilton, director of business development and analytics, at kevin.hamilton@sri.utoronto.ca or visit SRI’s CRC website.

How To Apply: Applications should include:

1) a letter of interest of no more than 3 pages. The letter should briefly describe the applicant’s proposed research program, leadership experience, fit with the CRC criteria for a Tier 1 chair and alignment with the foci of the Physical Sciences Platform, the University of Toronto strategic research plan (found here) and Sunnybrook’s strategic directions (found here);

Candidates are encouraged to explain any interruptions in order to allow for a fair assessment of their application.

Application instructions: Please note that we only review your application if it is customized to the role through a cover letter or some context as to why you are interested in this role at our company - automatic / 1-click / resume-only applications don’t make it to a human.

Job Search is hard. To help you focus your time on the opportunities best suited for you, we would like you to know the following upfront:
Small, Growing Team: We are a team of less than 50 and, while growing, it is important to us that you love where you work from Day 1. This will be a hands-on build + lead role responsible for our end-to-end data stack. If you are looking for a large organization with very specialized and boxed roles, this opportunity is probably not for you.
Compensation: We don’t find it productive for you or us to go down a path of multiple conversations and then realize the logistics won’t work no matter how much mutual interest there is. So you should know the compensation for this role will be CAD $100K-$120K salary, up to 20% bonus based on performance, and equity which will range depending on the first two elements but would generally be at the normal level for an early employee given how critical this role is to our future
No Minimum Education or Years of Experience: We strongly believe that quality of talent is best measured by motivation, alignment of purpose, skills, depth of experiences, and learning agility. While your past learning and work experiences help us understand who you are, what has shaped you, and what you have been exposed to, we do not use minimum education or years of experience requirements in our job postings
Who you are:
A sharp, kind, and open-minded human driven by both excellence and impact
A freakishly quick learner who is actively staying on top of the latest in the world of data science and, preferably, keen to do the same for the future of work (the industry in which we operate) and SaaS (the type of business we are building)
Experienced with the full data stack - data analysis, data engineering, data science, and data infrastructure
Effective communicator with ability to act as a credible and trusted bridge with the Engineering and Leadership teams as well as our customers and the AI ecosystem
Looking to make significant contribution to building and growing an impact-driven AI and technology business over a period of several years
What you will focus on:
Data / AI Strategy & Execution (70%): Own the design, development, and delivery of our end-to-end data and AI strategy to power our platform supported by a small team that you will help develop and grow over time. Day-to-day, in addition to the ongoing strategy work, this role requires you to have significant skills and capabilities in delivering the following workflows with speed and quality on the execution side:
Design database structure/schema and conduct data ETL
Prepare data from multiple sources and APIs in various forms for our clients on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly)
Automate the data update and monitoring process
Build data solutions including search and ML models
Build and maintain necessary microservices for the data solutions
Leverage user data to improve existing ML models
Data / AI Internal & External Leadership (15%): Be the face of the company’s data / AI capabilities in helping communicate our technical work to other teams, customers, prospective technical talent, and the broader AI ecosystem
Relationship Management (15%): Coach and support Data team members as well as develop and manage relationships with data vendors and partners
The balance will increasingly shift away from significant hands-on execution as our team grows over the years.

What technical skills, tools, and frameworks you should be very comfortable with:
Proficiency in python
Proficiency in mainstream machine learning/deep learning frameworks: sklearn, tensorflow/keras/pytorch, etc.
Knowledge of classic and modern machine learning theories and algorithms especially for NLP tasks
Familiar with SQL and NoSQL (such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch) databases
Experience in modular design for software development, such as creating and working with microservices

Application instructions: Please note that we only review your application if it is customized to the role through a cover letter or some context as to why you are interested in this role at our company - automatic / 1-click / resume-only applications don’t make it to a human.

Job Search is hard. To help you focus your time on the opportunities best suited for you, we would like you to know the following upfront:
Small, Growing Team: We are a team of less than 50 and, while growing, it is important to us that you love where you work from Day 1. This will be a hands-on build + lead role responsible for our end-to-end data stack. If you are looking for a large organization with very specialized and boxed roles, this opportunity is probably not for you.
Compensation: We don’t find it productive for you or us to go down a path of multiple conversations and then realize the logistics won’t work no matter how much mutual interest there is. So you should know the compensation for this role will be CAD $100K-$120K salary, up to 20% bonus based on performance, and equity which will range depending on the first two elements but would generally be at the normal level for an early employee given how critical this role is to our future
No Minimum Education or Years of Experience: We strongly believe that quality of talent is best measured by motivation, alignment of purpose, skills, depth of experiences, and learning agility. While your past learning and work experiences help us understand who you are, what has shaped you, and what you have been exposed to, we do not use minimum education or years of experience requirements in our job postings
Who you are:
A sharp, kind, and open-minded human driven by both excellence and impact
A freakishly quick learner who is actively staying on top of the latest in the world of data science and, preferably, keen to do the same for the future of work (the industry in which we operate) and SaaS (the type of business we are building)
Experienced with the full data stack - data analysis, data engineering, data science, and data infrastructure
Effective communicator with ability to act as a credible and trusted bridge with the Engineering and Leadership teams as well as our customers and the AI ecosystem
Looking to make significant contribution to building and growing an impact-driven AI and technology business over a period of several years
What you will focus on:
Data / AI Strategy & Execution (70%): Own the design, development, and delivery of our end-to-end data and AI strategy to power our platform supported by a small team that you will help develop and grow over time. Day-to-day, in addition to the ongoing strategy work, this role requires you to have significant skills and capabilities in delivering the following workflows with speed and quality on the execution side:
Design database structure/schema and conduct data ETL
Prepare data from multiple sources and APIs in various forms for our clients on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly)
Automate the data update and monitoring process
Build data solutions including search and ML models
Build and maintain necessary microservices for the data solutions
Leverage user data to improve existing ML models
Data / AI Internal & External Leadership (15%): Be the face of the company’s data / AI capabilities in helping communicate our technical work to other teams, customers, prospective technical talent, and the broader AI ecosystem
Relationship Management (15%): Coach and support Data team members as well as develop and manage relationships with data vendors and partners
The balance will increasingly shift away from significant hands-on execution as our team grows over the years.

What technical skills, tools, and frameworks you should be very comfortable with:
Proficiency in python
Proficiency in mainstream machine learning/deep learning frameworks: sklearn, tensorflow/keras/pytorch, etc.
Knowledge of classic and modern machine learning theories and algorithms especially for NLP tasks
Familiar with SQL and NoSQL (such as MongoDB, ElasticSearch) databases
Experience in modular design for software development, such as creating and working with microservices

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With


The Data team at Carta is transforming what decision making looks like at the company. We believe that our data is what is key to setting us apart and will help us succeed as a data driven company.

The team is currently composed of professionals in Data Science/ Machine Learning space, advanced Data Analytics space, and Data engineering. We like to partner with each other and with Cartans across the company to get our work done, and we like to constantly think about how we can improve. We also like to come up with new product ideas based on data.

The Problems You'll Solve


As a member of this team, you will be responsible for building and scaling our pipelines to make data accurate, accessible and secure. You will build systems that will allow the rest of the company answer questions they need in a self-service manner, and allow analysts and data scientists to quickly analyze and prototype new ideas. You will partner with the rest of the team on prototyping those new ideas and build scalable products. Examples of responsibilities will include:
Build resilient data pipelines based on internal and external data sources
Implement data security practices to support CartaX, compliance & legal, and other areas of the company that require additional safeguards
Build or evaluate tooling for data accuracy detection and alerting
Partner with the rest of the team on prototyping and building scalable products driven by the data team
Partner with teams throughout Carta on identifying opportunities and building solutions to help in simplifying operations while producing rich and accurate data sets for us to use
Constantly identify opportunities for providing self-service tooling to our internal partners
The Impact You'll Have


By building scalable self-service solutions you will enable easier and faster decision making. In addition, you will be able to increase productivity and accuracy of our data team, and operations and product teams as well

About You


Successful candidates in this role will have at least 5+ years of experience, and will always be on the lookout for the blanace between fast delivery and building for scale. You don't follow the status quo but look for ways to improve how we do things. You are able to talk to technical and business users and explain your work, and are able to be a good partner to your team and to your customers. Building relationships is a priority. Even though our toolstack (Airflow, DBT, Redshift & Looker) are a good start, you will always be in the know on the latest and greatest technology we could utilize. You concentrate on automation and self service. You are also excited to build new products, starting with ideas and all the way to execution. Example of problems you will solve include:
Building tools to automate data anomaly detection and alerting
Scaling our data infrastructure and developing software that allows for improved data processing and automation
Evaluating build vs buy tooling
Scaling Looker as a platform to solve operational use cases as well as increase self service adoption around the company

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With


The Data team at Carta is transforming what decision making looks like at the company. We believe that our data is what is key to setting us apart and will help us succeed as a data driven company. Members of the data team are working on understanding and making sense of data while partnering with product and business teams on helping drive direction with data. The team is currently composed of professionals in Data Science/ Machine Learning space, advanced Data Analytics space, and Data engineering. We like to partner with each other and with Cartans across the company to get our work done, and we like to constantly think about how we can improve. We also like to come up with new product ideas based on data.

The Problems You'll Solve


As a member of this team, you will be responsible for building and scaling our pipelines to make data accurate, accessible and secure. You will build systems that will allow the rest of the company answer questions they need in a self-service manner, and allow analysts and data scientists to quickly analyze and prototype new ideas. You will partner with the rest of the team on prototyping those new ideas and build scalable products. Examples of responsibilities will include:
Build resilient data pipelines based on internal and external data sources
Implement data security practices to support CartaX, compliance & legal, and other areas of the company that require additional safeguards
Build or evaluate tooling for data accuracy detection and alerting
Partner with the rest of the team on prototyping and building scalable products driven by the data team
Partner with teams throughout Carta on identifying opportunities and building solutions to help in simplifying operations while producing rich and accurate data sets for us to use
Constantly identify opportunities for providing self-service tooling to our internal partners
The Impact You'll Have


By building scalable self-service solutions you will enable easier and faster decision making. In addition, you will be able to increase productivity and accuracy of our data team, and operations and product teams as well

About You


Successful candidates in this role will have at least 5+ years of experience, and will always be on the lookout for the blanace between fast delivery and building for scale. You don't follow the status quo but look for ways to improve how we do things. You are able to talk to technical and business users and explain your work, and are able to be a good partner to your team and to your customers. Building relationships is a priority. Even though our toolstack (Airflow, DBT, Redshift & Looker) are a good start, you will always be in the know on the latest and greatest technology we could utilize. You concentrate on automation and self service. You are also excited to build new products, starting with ideas and all the way to execution. Example of problems you will solve include:
Building tools to automate data anomaly detection and alerting
Scaling our data infrastructure and developing software that allows for improved data processing and automation
Evaluating build vs buy tooling
Scaling Looker as a platform to solve operational use cases as well as increase self service adoption around the company

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With


The Data team at Carta is transforming what decision making looks like at the company. We believe that our data is what is key to setting us apart and will help us succeed as a data driven company. Members of the data team are working on understanding and making sense of data while partnering with product and business teams on helping drive direction with data. The team is currently composed of professionals in Data Science/ Machine Learning space, advanced Data Analytics space, and Data engineering. We like to partner with each other and with Cartans across the company to get our work done, and we like to constantly think about how we can improve. We also like to come up with new product ideas based on data.

The Problems You'll Solve


As a member of this team, you will be responsible for building and scaling our pipelines to make data accurate, accessible and secure. You will build systems that will allow the rest of the company answer questions they need in a self-service manner, and allow analysts and data scientists to quickly analyze and prototype new ideas. You will partner with the rest of the team on prototyping those new ideas and build scalable products. Examples of responsibilities will include:
Build resilient data pipelines based on internal and external data sources
Implement data security practices to support CartaX, compliance & legal, and other areas of the company that require additional safeguards
Build or evaluate tooling for data accuracy detection and alerting
Partner with the rest of the team on prototyping and building scalable products driven by the data team
Partner with teams throughout Carta on identifying opportunities and building solutions to help in simplifying operations while producing rich and accurate data sets for us to use
Constantly identify opportunities for providing self-service tooling to our internal partners
The Impact You'll Have


By building scalable self-service solutions you will enable easier and faster decision making. In addition, you will be able to increase productivity and accuracy of our data team, and operations and product teams as well

About You


Successful candidates in this role will have at least 5+ years of experience, and will always be on the lookout for the blanace between fast delivery and building for scale. You don't follow the status quo but look for ways to improve how we do things. You are able to talk to technical and business users and explain your work, and are able to be a good partner to your team and to your customers. Building relationships is a priority. Even though our toolstack (Airflow, DBT, Redshift & Looker) are a good start, you will always be in the know on the latest and greatest technology we could utilize. You concentrate on automation and self service. You are also excited to build new products, starting with ideas and all the way to execution. Example of problems you will solve include:
Building tools to automate data anomaly detection and alerting
Scaling our data infrastructure and developing software that allows for improved data processing and automation
Evaluating build vs buy tooling
Scaling Looker as a platform to solve operational use cases as well as increase self service adoption around the company
Evaluating and rearchitecting our data model to support existing and future products
Partnering with external teams to help in data modeling requirements to support analytics
Understanding the needs of external teams, identify pain points and opportunities, and come back with proposals on how data engineering practice can help
Rearchitecting solutions such as Amplitude to allow for faster and more accurate reporting
Partner with the rest of data team to develop best in class software solutions to stand up products based on our data

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With


The Data team at Carta is transforming what decision making looks like at the company. We believe that our data is what is key to setting us apart and will help us succeed as a data driven company. Members of the data team are working on understanding and making sense of data while partnering with product and business teams on helping drive direction with data. The team is currently composed of professionals in Data Science/ Machine Learning space, advanced Data Analytics space, and Data engineering. We like to partner with each other and with Cartans across the company to get our work done, and we like to constantly think about how we can improve. We also like to come up with new product ideas based on data.

The Problems You'll Solve


As a member of this team, you will be responsible for building and scaling our pipelines to make data accurate, accessible and secure. You will build systems that will allow the rest of the company answer questions they need in a self-service manner, and allow analysts and data scientists to quickly analyze and prototype new ideas. You will partner with the rest of the team on prototyping those new ideas and build scalable products. Examples of responsibilities will include:
Build resilient data pipelines based on internal and external data sources
Implement data security practices to support CartaX, compliance & legal, and other areas of the company that require additional safeguards
Build or evaluate tooling for data accuracy detection and alerting
Partner with the rest of the team on prototyping and building scalable products driven by the data team
Partner with teams throughout Carta on identifying opportunities and building solutions to help in simplifying operations while producing rich and accurate data sets for us to use
Constantly identify opportunities for providing self-service tooling to our internal partners
The Impact You'll Have


By building scalable self-service solutions you will enable easier and faster decision making. In addition, you will be able to increase productivity and accuracy of our data team, and operations and product teams as well

About You


Successful candidates in this role will have at least 5+ years of experience, and will always be on the lookout for the blanace between fast delivery and building for scale. You don't follow the status quo but look for ways to improve how we do things. You are able to talk to technical and business users and explain your work, and are able to be a good partner to your team and to your customers. Building relationships is a priority. Even though our toolstack (Airflow, DBT, Redshift & Looker) are a good start, you will always be in the know on the latest and greatest technology we could utilize. You concentrate on automation and self service. You are also excited to build new products, starting with ideas and all the way to execution. Example of problems you will solve include:
Building tools to automate data anomaly detection and alerting
Scaling our data infrastructure and developing software that allows for improved data processing and automation
Evaluating build vs buy tooling
Scaling Looker as a platform to solve operational use cases as well as increase self service adoption around the company

"Senior Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure",CA$67k-CA$82k (Glassdoor Est.),"The Company You'll Join


At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.

We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.

At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.

To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series F.

The Team You'll Work With


The Data team at Carta is transforming what decision making looks like at the company. We believe that our data is what is key to setting us apart and will help us succeed as a data driven company.

We also like to come up with new product ideas based on data.

The Problems You'll Solve


As a member of this team, you will be responsible for building and scaling our pipelines to make data accurate, accessible and secure. You will build systems that will allow the rest of the company answer questions they need in a self-service manner, and allow analysts and data scientists to quickly analyze and prototype new ideas. You will partner with the rest of the team on prototyping those new ideas and build scalable products. Examples of responsibilities will include:
Build resilient data pipelines based on internal and external data sources
Implement data security practices to support CartaX, compliance & legal, and other areas of the company that require additional safeguards
Build or evaluate tooling for data accuracy detection and alerting
Partner with the rest of the team on prototyping and building scalable products driven by the data team
Partner with teams throughout Carta on identifying opportunities and building solutions to help in simplifying operations while producing rich and accurate data sets for us to use
Constantly identify opportunities for providing self-service tooling to our internal partners
The Impact You'll Have


By building scalable self-service solutions you will enable easier and faster decision making. In addition, you will be able to increase productivity and accuracy of our data team, and operations and product teams as well

About You


Successful candidates in this role will have at least 5+ years of experience, and will always be on the lookout for the blanace between fast delivery and building for scale. You don't follow the status quo but look for ways to improve how we do things. You are able to talk to technical and business users and explain your work, and are able to be a good partner to your team and to your customers. Building relationships is a priority. Even though our toolstack (Airflow, DBT, Redshift & Looker) are a good start, you will always be in the know on the latest and greatest technology we could utilize. You concentrate on automation and self service. You are also excited to build new products, starting with ideas and all the way to execution. Example of problems you will solve include:
Building tools to automate data anomaly detection and alerting
Scaling our data infrastructure and developing software that allows for improved data processing and automation
Evaluating build vs buy tooling
Scaling Looker as a platform to solve operational use cases as well as increase self service adoption around the company
